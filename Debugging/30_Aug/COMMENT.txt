case F: remove rows / columns in GGL part

0. no removal
1. remove low z clustering
2. remove high z clustering



Here we take only two redshift bins.

Furthermore:
- we include shear-shear (for all) & clustering-clustering
- case A: only autocorrelations in clustering-clustering
- case B: all clustering-clustering
- l-cuts on the clustering-part are imposed.
- galaxy bias is not marginalized over


RESULTS

The bias shows consistent behaviour across all parameters:
(in dependence on the GGL cutting)

- the lowest bias is obtained for low-z clustering
- the bias increases moderately for high-z clustering and low-z shear
- the bias increases sharply (factor 5) for high-z clustering and high-z shear




CHECK

How do things behave if we marginalize over galaxy bias as well?
Do the errors increase substantially?
