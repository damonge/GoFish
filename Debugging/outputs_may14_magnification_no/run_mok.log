Computing background
 -> ncdm species i=1 sampled with 11 (resp. 5) points for purpose of background (resp. perturbation) integration. In the relativistic limit it gives Delta N_eff = 1.0132
 -> total N_eff = 3.046 (sumed over ultra-relativistic and ncdm species)
 -> non-cold dark matter species with i=1 has m_i = 6.000000e-02 eV (so m_i / omega_i =9.318986e+01 eV)
 -> age = 13.456588 Gyr
 -> conformal age = 13798.955962 Mpc
Computing thermodynamics with Y_He=0.2483
 -> recombination at z = 1088.466196
    corresponding to conformal time = 276.935047 Mpc
    with comoving sound horizon = 142.004916 Mpc
    angular diameter distance = 12.371568 Mpc
    and sound horizon angle 100*theta_s = 1.053574
 -> baryon drag stops at z = 1063.077517
    corresponding to conformal time = 281.809704 Mpc
    with comoving sound horizon rs = 144.189098 Mpc
 -> reionization  at z = 8.149460
    corresponding to conformal time = 4855.163867 Mpc
